# COVID-19 Data Exploration & Analysis (SQL)
End-to-end SQL-based analysis of global COVID-19 deaths and vaccination data, transforming raw datasets into meaningful insights using advanced queries, joins, and analytical views.


##Project Overview

The objective is to transform raw pandemic data into **meaningful insights** that help understand infection trends, mortality rates, and vaccination progress across countries and regions. The project demonstrates strong SQL querying skills, data exploration techniques, and analytical thinking aligned with real-world business and public health reporting scenarios.

The analysis uses structured COVID-19 datasets containing **daily case counts, deaths, population metrics, and vaccination records**, enabling insight generation at country and global levels.

##Project Objectives
- Analyze COVID-19 infection and death trends across countries  
- Calculate mortality rates and infection percentages relative to population  
- Track vaccination progress and coverage over time  
- Create reusable SQL views for reporting and analysis  

---

##Dataset
- **Sources:**  
  - `covid_deaths.csv`  
  - `covid_vaccination.csv`

- **Data includes:**  
  - Country and continent-level data  
  - Total and new COVID-19 cases  
  - Total and new deaths  
  - Population statistics  
  - Vaccination counts and rollout progress  

---

##Tools & Technologies Used
- **SQL**
  - Data exploration and analysis  
  - Aggregations, joins, CTEs, window functions  
  - View creation for reusable insights  

- **Database**
  - Relational database (SQL Server / MySQL compatible syntax)

- **Excel / CSV**
  - Data source files for importing into SQL database

##Key Analysis Performed
- Death percentage calculation by country and date  
- Infection rate analysis relative to population  
- Identification of countries with highest death counts  
- Continent-level COVID-19 impact analysis  
- Vaccination progress analysis using joins and window functions  
- Creation of SQL views for dashboard or reporting use  

---

##Deliverables
- SQL analysis queries (`covid-data-exploration-sqlquery.sql`)  
- SQL views for reporting (`covid-data-exploration-view-sql.sql`)  
- Raw datasets (`covid_deaths.csv`, `covid_vaccination.csv`)

##Business / Analytical Impact
The insights from this project can support:
- Public health trend analysis and reporting  
- Data-driven decision-making for policy and healthcare planning  
- Dashboard development and automated reporting  
- Demonstration of real-world SQL analytics skills
